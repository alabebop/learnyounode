# Learn super basics of node!

This repository is a learning project I created along the way of doing the [learnyounode workshop](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode) from [nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers). It was a weekend project that went very smoothly and great fun.

As the new week began, to keep the fun and the challenge sweetness, as well as to let the knowledge sink in, I decided to use the README.md to take learning notes. 

Hence the following long notes collecting the commands and ideas I've picked up, in the chapters' order of the workshop.


## 1. HELLO WORLD

* To run a node JS program
```
$ node program.js
```

* To write to the standard output in node
```javascript
console.log('text')
```
