# Learn super basics of node!

This repository is a learning project I created along the way of doing the [learnyounode workshop](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode) from [nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers). It was a weekend project that went very smoothly and great fun.

As the new week began, to keep the fun and the challenge sweetness, as well as to let the knowledge sink in, I decided to use the README.md to take learning notes. 

Hence the long text here, in the chapters' order of the workshop.
